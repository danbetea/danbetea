- 👋 Hi, my name is Dan Betea (@danbetea). I am a research and data scientist with degrees in mathematics (PhD) and computer science (BS). On this page I'll post small pieces of code that might be useful to the (statistical/machine learning/mathematical/physical/programming) community; languages included are Julia, Mathematica, Python, C/C++, and perhaps others. 

- 👀 My current interests, in order, are: 

  - machine/statistical learning;
  - data science;
  - adjacent subjects like simulations (e.g. Markov Chain Monte Carlo) and numerical methods therein;
  - probability and statistics, mathematical physics, (algebraic) combinatorics.
 
- I am currently looking for new challenges in the industry. If you want to get in touch, see email below.

- 💞️ I’m also always looking for collaborators on various aspects and projects from my interests listed above. Topics include: 
  - regression and classification models;
  - transfer lerning (e.g. particular applications of neural style transfer to various fields);
  - simulations and numerical aspects of various models in statistical mechanics and physics and adjancent fields; 
  - random sampling methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques.
