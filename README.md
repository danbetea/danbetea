- 👋 Hi, I’m Dan (@danbetea). On this page I'll post small bites of code that might be useful to the (mathematical/physical/programming) community; languages included are Julia, Mathematica, Python, C/C++, and perhaps others. 
- 👀 I’m interested in probability and statistics, mathematical physics and adjacent subjects, simulations and numerical methods therein.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simulations and numerical aspects of various models in probability, statistics, statistical mechanics and physics (e.g. random matrix models, random tilings, vertex models, bosonic and fermionic models, etc.), and on connected topics (e.g. machine learning, data science), as my expertise and time permits
