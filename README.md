- 👋 Hi, I’m Dan (@danbetea). On this page I'll post small bites of code that might be useful to the (mathematical/physical/programming) community; languages included are Julia, Mathematica, Python, C/C++, and perhaps others. 
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematical physics and adjacent subjects, simulations and numerical methods therein.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simulations and numerical aspects in statistical mechanics and physics (e.g. random matrix models, random tilings, vertex models, bosonic and fermionic models, etc.), and on connected subjects (e.g. machine learning, statistics) if possible and if my expertise permits.
