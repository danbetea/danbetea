- 👋 Hi, I’m Dan (@danbetea). On this page I'll post small bites of code that might be useful to the (statistical/machine learning/mathematical/physical/programming) community; languages included are Julia, Mathematica, Python, C/C++, and perhaps others. 
- 👀 I’m interested in machine/statistical learning and data science, probability, mathematical physics, algebraic combinatorics, and adjacent subjects like simulations and numerical methods therein.
- 💞️ I’m always looking for collaborators on various aspects of machine and statistical learning, data science, and probability. Topics include: regression and classification models, perhaps with simulated data of physical origin; neural style transfer, and other forms of transfer learning; simulations and numerical aspects of various models in probability, statistics, statistical mechanics and physics (e.g. random matrix models, random tilings, vertex models, bosonic and fermionic models, etc.); random sampling methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques.
- 📫 How to reach me : firstName DOT lastName AT outlook DOT com.
