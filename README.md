- 👋 Hi, I’m Dan (@danbetea). On this page I'll post small bites of code that might be useful to the (statistical/machine learning/mathematical/physical/programming) community; languages included are Julia, Mathematica, Python, C/C++, and perhaps others. 
- 👀 I’m interested in machine/statistical learning and data science, probability, mathematical physics, algebraic combinatorics, and adjacent subjects like simulations and numerical methods therein.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various aspects of machine and statistical learning, data science, and probability. Topics of interest: neural transfer; regression and classification models with simulated (perhaps of physical origin) data; simulations and numerical aspects of various models in probability, statistics, statistical mechanics and physics (e.g. random matrix models, random tilings, vertex models, bosonic and fermionic models, etc.).
- 📫 How to reach me : firstName DOT lastName AT outlook DOT com.
